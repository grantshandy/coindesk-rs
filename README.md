# coindesk
Bitcoin price index API powered by [coindesk.com](https://coindesk.com).

```
coindesk = "0.1.0"
```

Because this is an async library you will need an async runtime like `async_std` or `tokio`.

Example:
```rust
use coindesk::Bitcoin;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let data = Bitcoin::get().await.unwrap();

    println!("currency: {}, rate: {}, description: {}, symbol: {}", data.usd.code, data.usd.rate, data.usd.description, data.usd.symbol);
    println!("currency: {}, rate: {}, description: {}, symbol: {}", data.gbp.code, data.gbp.rate, data.gbp.description, data.gbp.symbol);
    println!("currency: {}, rate: {}, description: {}, symbol: {}", data.eur.code, data.eur.rate, data.eur.description, data.eur.symbol);
    println!("time: {}", data.time);
}
```

Output:
```
currency: USD, rate: 57532.8599, description: United States Dollar, symbol: &#36;
currency: GBP, rate: 41359.4525, description: British Pound Sterling, symbol: &pound;
currency: EUR, rate: 47927.864, description: Euro, symbol: &euro;
time: 2021-05-05 15:58:00 UTC
```
The time field implements `chrono::DateTime` for integration with the rest of your project.
